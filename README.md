# Blender-Live_Audio_Visualizer
A live audio visualizer built on an existing audio visualizer add-on for Blender 4.x

Built upon the *Simple Audio Visualizer* plugin by Polyfjord, and created alongside Copilot, this alternative add-on will take live audio feed from a VAC (Virtual Audio Cable) and provide transformation data to an array of objects, producing a live, viewport renderable (in EEVEE) audio visualizer for music, videos, or other media.
